Colloquium is a minimalistic text-based mental health support system that provides users with essential information and resources for managing mental health challenges.
Users can log in, choose from different conditions like Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, or Insomnia, and access relevant support options.
While the project is rudimentary and lacks the interactivity and security required for a production application, it serves as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive mental health support system. 
Users can explore resources and information related to their chosen condition and receive basic support. 
However, it's crucial to emphasize that Colloquium should not replace professional mental health advice, and users should seek help from qualified experts when needed.
